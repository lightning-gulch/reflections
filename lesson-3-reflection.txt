When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would probably want to use a remote repository in situations where you are 
    collaborating with others that are using their own workstations with local 
    repositories. Or in situations where you want a backup of your work in a remote
    location. Or if you want to have the repository public for contributors to view
    and add to.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In situations where you are colaborating with others you may not be ready for your
	work to be pulled from your local repo. Automatic pulls takes this control away.
